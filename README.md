For practice and learning React

## Support:
For any questions, find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simrat-karamjeet/)

## Roadmap:
This exercise is for educational purposes only.  I would like to add a feature in each Square component that once it has been clicked, it doesn't let the user click again and change its value
